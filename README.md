# LD51 Source - Title: [NOT YET SET]

## Orientation
This is the source code for TwoWolf's Ludum Dare 51st Entry. This includes everything in the Assets folder including external plugins, packages, sprites, and external files such as Photoshop/Aesprite. All this does not go over 20mb so I did not bother erasing them.

It's currently 6 hours before d-day. There is no theme yet and therefore of course no game.

## How to Play
Game not yet made.
